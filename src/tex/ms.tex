\begin{abstract}
    This project aims to create a framework for calibrating uncertainty expectations in various ML and statistical models.
    It builds on DeepBench's pendulum module, controlling error injection, calculating an analytic expectation for the error impact on the final confidence intervals, and comparing this expectation to that produced by various uncertainty-aware ML and statistical techniques.
    Here, we pursue the following modeling techniques: hierarchical and non-hierarchical Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling (\texttt{numpyro}), hierarchical and non-hierarchical simulation-based inference (\texttt{mackelab}), and deep ensembles.
    We inject aleatoric error on the pendulum parameters individually ($L$, $\theta_0$, and $a_g$) at a variety of levels (1\%, 10\%, and 50\%).
    We compare this to expectations of aleatoric and epistemic error from the various ML techniques and explore the bias and confidence of the models compared to our analytic expectation.
