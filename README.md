## Installation

### Install via venv and pypi
> python3.10 -m venv test_env

>source test_env/bin/activate

> pip install deepuq

> pip show deepuq

Verify the install works by also pip installing pytest, cd'ing to the DeepUQ/ directory, and running
> pytest

### Clone this repo
First, cd to where you'd like to put this repo and type:
> git clone https://github.com/deepskies/DeepUQ.git

Then, cd into the repo:
> cd DeepUQ

### Preferred installation method: Poetry
Poetry is our recommended method of handling a package environment as publishing and building is handled by a toml file that handles all possibly conflicting dependencies. 
Full docs can be found [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/).

Install instructions: 

Add poetry to your python install 
> pip install poetry

Then, from within the DeepUQ repo, run the following:

Install the pyproject file
> poetry install 

Begin the environment
> poetry shell

### Verify DeepUQ is installed correctly

After following the installation instructions, verify installation is functional is all tests are passing by running the following in the root directory:
> pytest

## How to run the workflow
![Folder structure overview](images/DeepUQWorkflow_Maggie.png)

The scripts can be accessed via the ipython example notebooks or via the model modules (ie `DeepEnsemble.py`). For example, to ingest data and train a Deep Ensemble from the DeepUQ/ directory:

> python src/scripts/DeepEnsemble.py

With no config file specified, this command will pull settings from the `default.py` file within `utils`. For the `DeepEnsemble.py` script, it will automatically select the `DefaultsDE` dictionary.

Another option is to specify your own config file:

> python src/scripts/DeepEnsemble.py --config "path/to/config/myconfig.yaml"

Where you would modify the "path/to/config/myconfig.yaml" to specify where your own yaml lives.

The third option is to input settings on the command line. These choices are then combined with the default settings and output in a temporary yaml.

> python src/scripts/DeepEnsemble.py --noise_level "low" --n_models 10 --out_dir ./DeepUQResources/results/ --save_final_checkpoint True --savefig True --n_epochs 10

This command will train a 10 network, 10 epoch ensemble on the low noise data and will save figures and final checkpoints to the specified directory. Required arguments are the noise setting (low/medium/high), the number of ensembles, and the working directory.

For more information on the arguments:
> python src/scripts/DeepEnsemble.py --help

The other available script is the `DeepEvidentialRegression.py` script:
> python src/scripts/DeepEvidentialRegression.py --help
